# C# Tutorial â€“ Create a Save The Eggs Item Drop Game in Visual Studio
In this game we are making a simple item drop down game called save the eggs in visual studio with windows form and c# programming. In this game you we will animate some egg picture boxes and have a chicken with a bucket thats going to save  as many eggs as she can while they are dropping from top of the screen. You have two scoring systems, in one it shows how many eggs you saved and second one will show many eggs you missed. 

In this project, we are using picture boxes, timer and labels and events. There are key up, key down and timer events that make the game work in background. We will make this game from the beginning in this project, I hope you find this project helpful in your journey and I'll see you on the next one. Moo out and Happy Programming.
